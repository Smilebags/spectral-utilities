This entrypoint shows a CIE XY chart overlaid with the boundary of the sRGB gamut and an interactive diagram of the gaussian spectrum.

Saturation mode shpws the path towards white when desaturating a wavelength by widening the gaussian spectrum centered around that wavelength.
Hue mode shows loops around IE which contain all of the values with equal gaussian width.

'Sweep values' draws a series of values in the current mode. Using this in one mode, switching to the other mode, and using it again, can produce the 'net' containing paths from pure wavelengths to white, and concentric rings of equal gaussian width.
