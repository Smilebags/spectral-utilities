This entrypoint is a work in progress mockup of a potential UI for selecting spectral colours directly using a model such as wavelength, width and scale. The goal of this UI is to provide a familiar interface to an HSL wheel, but with the added ability to combine multiple gaussian lobes to form more complex spectra in an intuitive and compact way, by use of adding and interacting with multiple 'pegs' on the hue/wavelength wheel.

The concept has not been implemented very fully at all in the code yet.
