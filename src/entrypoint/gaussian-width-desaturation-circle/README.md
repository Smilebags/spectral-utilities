title: Gaussian Width Desaturation Circle
---
This entrypoint draws the net described in [gamut-mapping](./gamut-mapping/README.md) unwrapped to a unit circle such that the concentric loops are mapped to circles, and the paths from pure wavelengths to white are radial lines. The gaussian width > radius mapping is heavily nonlinear in order to achieve a more uniform progression of saturation.

I have not yet uncovered a metric for determining a uniform progression of saturation with respect to gaussian width.
